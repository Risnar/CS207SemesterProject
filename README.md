# CS 207 SemesterProject: Fancy Bubble Machine
===================================

This repository is for a semester project of the CS 207 â€“ Building Interactive Gadgets
Course. The aim of the project is to build a 3D Spherical Atmosphere Encapsulated Phosphorous
Printer and a CNC Anti-Gravity transparent Orb Machine at the same time. The
target solution is a Bubble-Machine after the model of Bernard Katz Glass. The model is based on a movable arm that dips
a ring in soapy water. Afterwards, it turns around and a fan gets activated to blow bubbles into the air.

Repository Contents
============
Here's where you'll provide a map of all the top-level contents (where applicable):

* **/documentation** - In this folder you will find all the documentation I handed in during this project.
* **/src** - In this folder is the source code for the bubble machine.
* **/hardware** - Here are all models and schematics.
* **/libraries** - Any libraries that are needed to build your software for your device.
* **/img** - This is where all images are stored.
* **/LICENSE** - The license file.
* **/README.md** - The file you're reading now! :-D

Requirements and Materials
============

This is where you talk about what sort of libraries are required and what sort of hardware is needed:

Dependencies:
* energia-1.6.10E18 https://www.energia.nu
* msp430 command-line flasher https://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-flasher
* important libraries that need to be installed

Bill of Materials:
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x Motor shield
* 2x Micro servos
* 1x DC toy motor
* 1x Bubble-Mix
* 1x roll of perforated metal tape
* 1x plastic plate
* 1x Stripe of LED
* 1x Laser pointer
* Nuts and bolts of various sizes
* aluminum channel
* 1 threaded rod hanger/ plate
* museum wax
* 5 minute epoxy
* acrylic sheet- about 6" x 6" worth
* acrylic adhesive

Build Instructions
==================

Here is where you give specific instructions about how the device is built. The more detail the better -- especially if your build is very complicated. Here you should include schematics of your build.

If there are any special instructions on how to assemble the hardware, we should note it here as well. For example, if the user should solder things in a specific order, you should give them a heads-up.


Usage
=====
This is usually where you tell the user how the device works. Do you just upload the software and flip a switch? What sort of things does this thing do? Are there alternate settings / modes / programs that might be good to mention. This is where you tell the user exactly how the device or program is used. For example:

* Upload the code to the thing.
* Turn the thing on.
* The thing will do a thing and it'll be really cool.
* Don't forget to feed the badgers!

Credits
=======
I would like to give credit to:

* Bernard Katz Glass - He gave me the idea and the model described on the website www.instructables.com
